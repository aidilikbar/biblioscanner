ðŸ“˜ JOURNAL ARTICLES:
1. Kotter, J. P. (1995). Leading change: Why transformation efforts fail. Harvard Business Review, 73(2), 59â€“67.
DOI: [N/A - HBR articles typically donâ€™t have DOIs]
Kotter outlines an eight-step model for successful organizational transformation. It supports Theory Oâ€™s emphasis on building internal capability and culture, while warning against short-term fixes often aligned with Theory E. This article is a staple for change leaders seeking sustainable outcomes.

2. Nadler, D. A., & Tushman, M. L. (1997). Competing by design: The power of organizational architecture. Oxford University Press.
ISBN: 9780195116489
This work offers a framework for aligning organizational components such as strategy, structure, and culture â€” directly complementing Beer & Nohriaâ€™s integration of Theory E and O. Itâ€™s particularly relevant for organizations aiming to balance performance and human capital.


ðŸ“š BOOKS:
1. Kotter, J. P. (2012). Leading change (Rev. ed.). Harvard Business Review Press.
ISBN: 9781422186435
An expanded version of the 1995 HBR article, this book dives deeper into each of Kotterâ€™s eight steps. It aligns well with Theory Oâ€™s structured yet people-centered change processes and offers practical tools for change leadership in dynamic environments.

2. Collins, J., & Porras, J. I. (2004). Built to last: Successful habits of visionary companies (Rev. ed.). HarperBusiness.
ISBN: 9780060516406
While not exclusively focused on change, this book studies enduring companies that embraced cultural strength (Theory O) while maintaining high performance (Theory E). The findings emphasize the long-term benefit of integrated strategies for sustainable success.
